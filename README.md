# 🏥 Patient Appointment Booking Portal

A modern solution for seamless hospital and clinic operations — **real-time patient appointment scheduling, EHR dashboards, and inventory management** in one unified platform.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Patient Appointment Booking Portal** tackles real-world healthcare pains: long queues, manual paperwork, and fragmented inventory tracking. Built in response to a government hackathon challenge, it combines web and mobile experiences to deliver a streamlined workflow for both patients and hospital staff.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- **Multi-Platform Experience**  
  - **Android App (User-Facing):** Patients register, book appointments, and track status.
  - **Web Portal (Staff/Doctor-Facing):** Patient EHR dashboard, appointment management, and inventory tracking.

- **Real-Time Data:**  
  All operations powered by Firebase Firestore for instant updates without refreshes.

- **Minimal, Responsive UI:**  
  Clean, Bootstrap-styled dashboards built in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Hackathon Award-Winning:**  
  1st Place in D4 GDG Community Hackathon backed by a government ministry.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- **End-to-End Ownership:** Full-stack web app, UI/UX, real-time backend integration, and database design.
- **Collaborative Delivery:** Seamless integration with Android app for a unified digital health experience.
- **Impact:** Designed around actual government problem statements in public healthcare.
